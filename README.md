# Spatial Databases

## Project Description

**Brief Description:**
This repository contains tasks completed during Spatial Databases classes. The included files consist of SQL queries (PostgreSQL) with the PostGIS extension, commands on geometries, and raster operations. Additionally, a spatial data processing pipeline has been implemented using FME (Feature Manipulation Engine).

## Repository Contents

1. **`zaj[1-5]zadanie domowe.txt`**: SQL queries focusing on geometry operations.

2. **`tiff2filegdb.fmw`**: FME workspace file containing the spatial data processing workflow.
   
3. **`cw6-tutorial-czesc[1-2].pdf`**: Commands for raster data processing.

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension for executing SQL queries.
- FME (Feature Manipulation Engine) for running the spatial data processing pipeline.

## Notes

- The SQL queries cover operations on both geometries and raster data.
- The FME pipeline showcases a comprehensive workflow for spatial data processing.
- All comments and text in the notebooks are written in Polish.
